# Steam Library Risk Scanner

A PowerShell script that scans your Steam library and evaluates potential **security and privacy risks** associated with installed games.  
The script assigns each title a **risk score** based on factors like developer/publisher origin, anti-cheat type, DRM presence, and other red flags, and generates an **HTML report** for easy review.
